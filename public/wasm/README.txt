- openscad-official/openscad.wasm - WebAssembly binary with Manifold CSG support

Why This Build?
- Includes Manifold geometry engine (5-30x faster CSG operations)
- Official build maintained by OpenSCAD core team
- Same build used by OpenSCAD Playground (ochafik.com/openscad2)
- Supports --enable=manifold, --enable=fast-csg flags

Performance Benefits:
- Complex boolean operations: 5-30x faster
- Minkowski operations: 10-30x faster
- Binary STL export: 18x faster than ASCII

Previous Build:
- Replaced: openscad-wasm-prebuilt@1.2.0 (npm package, no Manifold support)
- Reason: Lacked Manifold, outdated, slow performance on complex models
