# 🧪 Testing Instructions - v1.10.0 Library Bundles

**Quick Start Guide for Manual Testing**

---

## ⚡ TL;DR - 5 Minute Test

1. **Open the app**: http://localhost:5173
2. **Upload test file**: Look for example buttons, find "Library Test" or upload `public/examples/library-test/library_test.scad`
3. **Check library panel**: Should see "📚 Libraries" with MCAD marked "required"
4. **Generate STL**: Click the button and verify no errors
5. **Success**: If STL downloads, library system works! 🎉

---

## 📋 Current Status

✅ **Setup Complete**
- Libraries downloaded (MCAD, BOSL2)
- Manifests created
- Test example ready
- Dev server running

⏳ **Needs Testing**
- Library detection
- Worker mounting
- Rendering with libraries
- UI functionality

---

## 🎯 Primary Test Objective

**Verify that the library-test example works:**

The test uses MCAD's `roundedBox()` function. If this renders successfully, it proves:
1. Parser detects library usage ✓
2. Library manager auto-enables MCAD ✓
3. Worker mounts MCAD files ✓
4. OpenSCAD can access library functions ✓
5. Rendering pipeline integrates correctly ✓

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Test

### Step 1: Load the Test Example

**Option A - From Welcome Screen** (easiest):
- Open http://localhost:5173
- Look for example buttons
- Click "Library Test" if available

**Option B - Manual Upload**:
- Click "Upload .scad file"
- Navigate to: `public/examples/library-test/library_test.scad`
- Select and upload

### Step 2: Verify Library Detection

Open browser DevTools (F12) and check Console tab for:

```
✅ Expected messages:
OpenSCAD Web Customizer v1.10.0
Detected libraries: ['MCAD']
Auto-enabled libraries: ['MCAD']
[Library] enable: MCAD
```

### Step 3: Check UI

Look in the parameters panel for "📚 Libraries" section:

```
📚 Libraries [1]
  ▼ Expand to see:
    
    ☑ ⚙️ MCAD (required)
       Mechanical CAD components
```

**Verify**:
- Badge shows "1"
- MCAD is checked
- "required" badge visible
- Panel can expand/collapse

### Step 4: Test Rendering

**Configure parameters** (should be defaults):
- Style: "Rounded"
- Width: 50
- Depth: 30
- Height: 25
- Radius: 5

**Trigger render**:
- Wait for auto-preview (if enabled), OR
- Click "Generate STL" button

**Note on URL Parameters (Stability Fix)**:
- If you load a shared URL with out-of-range values, the app now **clamps** them to the model's min/max.
- Example: `width=18` → clamped to `20`, `height=96` → clamped to `50`.
- This prevents CGAL assertion failures from invalid geometry.

**Watch console for**:
```
✅ Expected worker messages:
[Worker] Rendering with parameters: {...}
[Worker FS] Mounting library: MCAD from /libraries/MCAD
[Worker FS] Created directory: MCAD
[Worker FS] Mounted file: MCAD/boxes.scad (XXX bytes)
[Worker FS] Successfully mounted library: MCAD (36 files)
[Worker] Render complete: NNN triangles
```

### Step 5: Verify Success

**Success indicators**:
- ✅ No error messages
- ✅ Status shows "Ready" or "Preview ready"
- ✅ 3D preview shows rounded box (if preview enabled)
- ✅ "Download STL" button becomes active
- ✅ Clicking download works

**Failure indicators**:
- ❌ Error: "Failed to render model"
- ❌ Error: "File not found: MCAD/boxes.scad"
- ❌ Console shows library mounting errors
- ❌ Render times out

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Console Messages (Good Signs)

```javascript
// 1. Detection
"Detected libraries: ['MCAD']"

// 2. Auto-enable
"Auto-enabled libraries: ['MCAD']"

// 3. Worker mounting
"[Worker FS] Mounting library: MCAD from /libraries/MCAD"
"[Worker FS] Successfully mounted library: MCAD"

// 4. Render success
"[Worker] Render complete: 296 triangles"
```

### Console Errors (Problem Signs)

```javascript
// ❌ Detection failed
"Detected libraries: []" // Should have MCAD

// ❌ Mounting failed
"Failed to fetch /libraries/MCAD/manifest.json"
"Failed to mount library: MCAD"

// ❌ File not found
"Error: Cannot find file: MCAD/boxes.scad"
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Library Not Detected

**Symptoms**: Console shows `Detected libraries: []`

**Fix**:
- Verify include statement in test file: `use <MCAD/boxes.scad>;`
- Check parser.js has library detection code
- Refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue 2: Manifest Not Found

**Symptoms**: `Failed to fetch /libraries/MCAD/manifest.json`

**Fix**:
- Verify file exists: `public/libraries/MCAD/manifest.json`
- Check manifest.json is valid JSON
- Verify dev server is running
- Check Network tab in DevTools for 404 errors

### Issue 3: Worker Can't Find Library Files

**Symptoms**: `Error: Cannot find file: MCAD/boxes.scad`

**Fix**:
- Verify MCAD directory has .scad files
- Check manifest.json lists "boxes.scad"
- Verify worker mounted files (check console)
- Try disabling and re-enabling library in UI

### Issue 4: MCAD Not Auto-Enabled

**Symptoms**: Library detected but not checked in UI

**Fix**:
- Check libraryManager.autoEnable() is called
- Verify state has detectedLibraries
- Manually check MCAD checkbox
- Check console for errors

2. Try to render
3. Should get error (library required but disabled)
4. Re-check MCAD
5. Render should succeed

### Test 3: BOSL2

1. Create simple file with: `include <BOSL2/std.scad>; cuboid([20,30,40]);`
2. Upload
3. Verify BOSL2 detected
4. Enable BOSL2
5. Render

### Test 4: State Persistence

1. Enable MCAD and BOSL2
2. Refresh browser
3. Upload any file
