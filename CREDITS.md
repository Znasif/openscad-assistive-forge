## Rendering & Visual Techniques

### Shape-Vector Character Rendering

The shape-vector approach to character-based rendering used in this project was inspired by research and educational articles by **Alex Harri**.

- **Reference**: Alex Harri, character-based rendering technique article
- **URL**: https://alexharri.com/blog/ascii-rendering
- **Usage**: Educational reference for technique concepts
- **Note**: Implementation is clean-room; no code was copied

The article's exploration of 6-dimensional shape vectors, per-cell contrast enhancement, and treating characters as shapes rather than pixels informed the rendering approach.

## Design Inspirations

### Retrosmart X11 Cursors

Cursor icons are adapted from the **Retrosmart X11 Cursors** project by mdomlop.

- **Reference**: Retrosmart X11 cursor theme
- **URL**: https://github.com/mdomlop/retrosmart-x11-cursors
- **License**: GPL-3.0
- **Usage**: Cursor pixel designs adapted with color modifications
