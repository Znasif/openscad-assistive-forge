# Third-Party Notices

This document lists the third-party software used by OpenSCAD Web Customizer Forge and the web applications it generates.

## OpenSCAD (GPL-2.0-or-later)

Generated web applications include OpenSCAD compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for client-side STL generation.

**License**: GNU General Public License v2.0 or later
**Project**: https://openscad.org/
**Source Code**: https://github.com/openscad/openscad

### GPL Compliance for Generated Web Apps

When you deploy a generated web application that includes OpenSCAD WASM:

1. **You must provide access to the OpenSCAD source code** — either by:
   - Linking to the official GitHub repository, or
   - Hosting the source code yourself, or
   - Offering to provide the source upon request

2. **You must include this notice** (or equivalent) in your deployed application's "About" or "Licenses" section

3. **The GPL applies to OpenSCAD and this tool**, which means:
   - Your `.scad` model files retain your license
   - The web application (including OpenSCAD WASM) is GPL-3.0-or-later
   - Your parameter configurations are not affected
   - Generated STL files (data output) are not GPL-licensed

### Obtaining OpenSCAD Source

The source code for OpenSCAD is available at:
- https://github.com/openscad/openscad

If your model is licensed under a permissive license (MIT, Apache-2.0, CC0, etc.), the generated web app can be distributed freely (subject to OpenSCAD GPL compliance).
