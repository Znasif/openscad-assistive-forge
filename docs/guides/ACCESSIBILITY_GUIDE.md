5. **Status Updates**: Announced automatically via screen reader

### Screen Reader Features

#### Live Region Announcements

The app provides automatic announcements for:

- Parameter value changes (with debouncing to avoid spam)
- Model render status (in progress, complete, error)
- File upload results
- Library loading status
- Camera movement actions
- Preset loading confirmations

#### Helpful Landmarks

- `role="region"` on major sections with labels
- `role="status"` for render status updates
- `role="dialog"` for modal interactions
- `aria-live="polite"` for non-disruptive updates

### Forced Colors Mode (Windows High Contrast)

The app fully supports Windows High Contrast mode and other OS-enforced color schemes:

- All UI elements remain visible with system colors
- Focus indicators use outlines (not suppressed box-shadows)
- Borders are explicitly defined on all interactive elements

## For Clinicians and Caregivers

If you're customizing assistive devices (like AAC keyguards) for clients, this section will help you use the customizer efficiently in a clinical setting.

### Keyguard Workflow

See the dedicated [Keyguard Workflow Guide](./KEYGUARD_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions on customizing AAC keyguards.

### Preset Sharing for Collaboration

#### Saving Client Configurations

1. Adjust parameters for your client's needs
2. Click "Save Preset" in the Parameters panel
3. Name it descriptively (e.g., "Jane - Grid 4x5 - 15mm holes")
4. Click "Save"

#### Sharing Presets Between Sessions

Presets are saved in your browser's local storage. To share across devices:

1. Open Advanced menu → "View Params JSON"
2. Copy the JSON to clipboard
3. Send via email or paste into client notes
4. On another device, paste JSON and click "Apply"

### Quick Iteration for Trial Fittings

1. Start with a preset closest to your client's device
2. Adjust 1-2 key parameters (e.g., hole size, rail height)
3. Generate and download STL
4. 3D print test piece
5. Note adjustments needed
6. Reload preset and adjust
7. Repeat until perfect fit

### Color Considerations for CVI Users

Some AAC keyguards are used by clients with Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI) who benefit from high-contrast colors:

- Many AAC keyguard models support a `color` parameter
- Black keyguards often provide best contrast against device screens
- Use the "Model Color" picker in Preview Settings to test colors visually

### Multi-Client Management

Best practices for managing multiple client configurations:

- Use clear preset names with client initials and device info
- Document parameter values in client records
- Keep a backup JSON export in each client's file
- Review and update presets after each assessment

## For Novice Makers

New to 3D modeling and parametric customization? This section explains the basics.

### What Are Parameters?

Parameters are the adjustable values that control your 3D model. Common examples:

- **Size** (width, height, depth in millimeters)
- **Thickness** (wall thickness, typically 2-5mm)
- **Resolution** (detail level; higher = smoother curves but slower rendering)
- **Quantities** (how many holes, slots, or features)

#### Understanding Units

- Most models use **millimeters (mm)**
- 1 inch = 25.4mm
- Your 3D printer's build volume is typically listed in mm

### Safe Starting Values

If you're unsure what values to use:

1. **Start with defaults**: The model's author chose sensible defaults
2. **Make small changes**: Adjust one parameter at a time
3. **Use the Reset button**: Returns parameter to its default value
4. **Undo if needed**: Ctrl+Z undoes your last change

### Common Parameter Types

- **Slider**: Drag or use arrow keys to adjust numeric values
- **Dropdown**: Select from predefined options
- **Checkbox**: Toggle features on/off
- **Text**: Enter custom text or values

### What If I Break Something?

Don't worry! You can't break anything permanently:

- **Reset All**: Returns everything to defaults
- **Undo**: Reverses your last change (Ctrl+Z)
- **Reload Page**: Worst case, refresh your browser

### Getting Help

- **Parameter Help (?)**: Click the ? button next to parameters for explanations
- **Features Guide**: Click "Help" button for tutorials
- **Error Messages**: Read carefully—they often explain what went wrong
- **Example Models**: Try the built-in examples to learn how parameters work

## For Voice Input Users

If you use voice input software (Dragon NaturallySpeaking, Windows Voice Control, macOS Voice Control), this section ensures you can use all features.

### Speakable Interface Elements

All interactive elements have visible text labels or accessible names:

- **Buttons**: Named clearly ("Generate STL", "Save Preset", etc.)
- **Inputs**: Labeled with parameter names
- **Dropdowns**: Labeled with setting names

### Voice Command Tips

#### Common Commands (vary by software)

- "Click Generate STL" - Start rendering
- "Click Generate STL" - Start rendering
- "Click Save Preset" - Save current configuration  
- "Click Reset" - Reset parameters to defaults
- "Press Tab" - Navigate to next element
- "Press Enter" - Activate focused button

#### Parameter Adjustment

For numeric parameters:

- "Click [parameter name]" to focus
- "Type [number]" to set value
- "Press Enter" or "Press Tab" to apply

### Known Limitations

- **3D Preview Camera**: Voice commands for rotating the camera may be challenging. Use the on-screen camera control buttons instead.
- **Slider Drag**: Use keyboard (+/- or arrow keys) instead of "drag" commands

### Recommended Setup

1. Ensure all buttons and inputs have keyboard focus
2. Use voice commands to navigate via Tab
3. Use keyboard shortcuts for frequent actions (Ctrl+Z, etc.)
4. Enable "Show Keyboard Focus" in your OS accessibility settings

## Color System and Visual Accessibility

### Accessible Color Palette

The OpenSCAD Assistive Forge uses an accessible color system built on [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors), designed to meet **WCAG 2.2 AA** standards for normal themes and **WCAG AAA (7:1)** standards for high contrast mode.

#### Color Palette

- **Yellow (Accent)**: Primary brand color for buttons, links, and highlights
- **Green (Success)**: Successful operations and positive states
- **Teal (Info)**: Informational messages and secondary actions
- **Red (Error)**: Errors and destructive actions
- **Amber (Warning)**: Warnings and caution states
- **Neutral (Slate)**: Text, backgrounds, and borders

All colors are carefully selected to:
- Meet WCAG contrast requirements
- Be distinguishable for color blind users
- Work across light, dark, and high contrast themes
- Never convey information by color alone (WCAG 1.4.1)

### Theme Options

#### Light Theme

- Default theme with light backgrounds and dark text
- Optimized for bright environments
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliant (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI elements)

#### Dark Theme

- Dark backgrounds with light text
- Reduces eye strain in low-light conditions
- Same contrast requirements as light theme
- Automatically activates based on system preference (if not manually set)

#### High Contrast Mode

Toggle via the "HC" button in the header.

Features:
- **WCAG AAA** compliant (7:1 contrast for text)
- Larger text sizes (12-17% increase)
- Thicker borders (2-3px instead of 1px)
- Stronger focus indicators (4px instead of 3px)
- Brand-neutral colors for maximum contrast

Available in both light and dark variants.

### Focus Indicators

Focus indicators use **brand-neutral blue** (#0052cc in light mode, #66b3ff in dark mode) for:
- Consistency with OS conventions
- Clear distinction from brand yellow
- Optimal contrast against all backgrounds

All focus indicators meet **WCAG 2.4.13 Focus Appearance** requirements:
- Minimum 3px thickness (4px in high contrast mode)
- 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors
- Visible outline or box-shadow

### Skip Link

The skip link uses **AAA-compliant** colors for high contrast mode:
- Light mode: `#0047b3` background with white text (7:1 or better)
- Dark mode: `#66b3ff` background with black text (7:1 or better)

### Color Blindness Considerations

The palette is designed to be distinguishable for common color vision deficiencies:

- **Deuteranopia/Protanopia (Red-Green)**: Yellow and green have sufficient brightness difference
- **Tritanopia (Blue-Yellow)**: Teal provides clear distinction from yellow
- **All Types**: Icons and text accompany all color-coded states

**Important**: No information is conveyed by color alone (WCAG 1.4.1). All states include:
- ✓ Success states have checkmark icons
- ✗ Error states have X icons
- ⚠ Warning states have warning icons
- ℹ Info states have info icons

### Contrast Testing

The color system includes automated tests:
- WCAG 2.x contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI)
- WCAG AAA ratios for high contrast mode (7:1)
- APCA (future WCAG 3.0) informational checks

Tests run automatically with `npm test`.

### System Preferences

The app respects system-level accessibility preferences:

#### prefers-color-scheme

Automatically switches between light and dark themes based on your OS setting (unless manually overridden).

#### prefers-contrast

When "Increase Contrast" is enabled in your OS:
- Borders become thicker
- Focus indicators are enhanced
- Text contrast is increased
- Colors remain brand-appropriate

#### forced-colors (Windows High Contrast)

When Windows High Contrast or other OS color schemes are active:
- All colors map to system colors (Canvas, CanvasText, LinkText, etc.)
- Focus uses outline instead of box-shadow
- Borders are explicitly visible on all interactive elements
- No information is lost

#### prefers-reduced-motion

When "Reduce Motion" is enabled:
- Animations are disabled or minimized
- Transitions are instant
