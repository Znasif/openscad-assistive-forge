# Welcome Screen Feature Paths Guide

**Version:** 2.0 (January 2026)

## Overview

The Welcome screen's "Discover Features for Your Needs" section provides **entry points** with **guided tutorial sandboxes** to help users quickly learn the app.

In the current UI, the only visible entry point is a single beginner-friendly **Getting Started** tutorial that includes both workflow basics and UI orientation.

### What's New in v2.0

- **Reordered paths**: Educators/Advanced Makers first, Screen Reader last (prioritizing likely audiences)
- **Tutorial sandbox overlays**: Each path launches a 3-6 step guided walkthrough
- **Practical tips**: Cards show "what you'll learn" bullets before starting
- **Removed the old Screen Reader demo**: Screen Reader path now uses Simple Box example
- **Expanded Features Guide**: Updated to include Workflow/Actions and Accessibility tabs
- **New power features surfaced**: Actions menu (Share/Export/Compare/Queue), parameter search/jump, preview & export quality controls

## Design Philosophy

### Accessibility-First Discovery

The traditional "feature list" approach assumes all users want to see all features. This role-based approach:

1. **Reduces cognitive load** - Users see paths relevant to their needs first
2. **Improves discoverability** - Unusual accessibility features are highlighted, not buried
3. **Provides concrete examples** - "Try it" buttons load working examples immediately
4. **Respects user autonomy** - Users self-select their path based on their situation

### COGA-Friendly Language

All copy follows [WCAG 2.2 SC 3.1.5 Reading Level](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reading-level.html) guidelines:

- **Clear**: Short sentences, active voice, concrete terms
- **Consistent**: Same button labels ("Try", "Learn More") across all cards
- **Actionable**: Buttons describe what will happen ("Try Simple Box", not "Click here")

## UI Orientation

UI orientation is now included inside the single beginner-friendly **Getting Started** tutorial (so there’s only one intro tour to learn).

## Accessibility Spotlights

Below the role cards, 4 key accessibility features are highlighted with links:

1. **Keyboard-first design with logical tab order** → Links to Accessibility Guide
2. **High contrast & forced colors support** → Links to Accessibility Guide
3. **Plain-language error messages** → Links to Accessibility Guide
4. **Full workflow without drag gestures** → Links to Keyguard Workflow Guide

## Implementation Notes (Updated v2.1)

### Tutorial Sandbox System - Spotlight Coachmarks

All role paths now launch a **modern spotlight coachmark tutorial** after loading the example. The design follows best practices from Shepherd.js, Driver.js, and modern onboarding UX research.

**Module:** `src/js/tutorial-sandbox.js`

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Spotlight cutout**: SVG mask creates a visual "hole" around the target element
- **Floating coachmark**: Panel positions itself near the target (not centered over the UI)
- **Arrow pointer**: Visual arrow connects the panel to the highlighted element
- **Non-blocking**: Users can interact with highlighted elements through the spotlight
- **Streamlined content**: Short, scannable text focused on actions

**Features:**
- Step-by-step walkthroughs (4-6 steps per path)
- Floating panel with smart positioning (top, bottom, left, right based on space)
- Arrow pointer from panel to target element
- SVG spotlight with cutout around target (click-through enabled)
- Pulsing highlight ring on target element
- Minimize/restore toggle (collapses to floating pill button)
- Keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Escape, Tab)
- ARIA-friendly (tutorial region with live announcements)
- Step gating for "Try this" actions (Next enables after completing action)
- Auto-scroll to bring target elements into view
- Reduced motion support (disables animations)
- Forced-colors mode support (Windows High Contrast)
- Mobile-responsive (panel docks to bottom on small screens)
- Focus restoration to trigger button on close

**User Flow:**
1. User clicks "Start Tutorial" button on Welcome card
2. Example loads via `loadExampleByKey()`
3. Screen reader announces: "[Example name] loaded and ready to customize"
4. Tutorial overlay opens automatically after 500ms delay
5. Spotlight cutout highlights relevant UI element
6. Panel positions itself near target with arrow pointing to it
7. User can interact with highlighted element directly (no "Focus" button needed)
8. User steps through tutorial or presses Escape to exit
9. Focus returns to "Start Tutorial" button on close

### Tutorial Content Structure

Each tutorial follows this streamlined pattern:
- **Step 1**: Welcome/overview (what you'll learn, ~3 bullets, exit hint)
- **Steps 2-N**: Feature spotlights with `highlightSelector` and action prompts
- **Final step**: Completion summary and next steps

**Content Guidelines:**
- Keep text short and scannable
- Use `<strong>` for element names (e.g., "Click **Generate STL**")
- Use `<kbd>` for keyboard shortcuts (e.g., "Press <kbd>Esc</kbd>")
- Add `.tutorial-hint` class for secondary tips
- Completion actions should be simple (one click, one change)

All tutorials use `simple-box` example except Advanced Makers (uses `library-test`).

### Documentation Links

"Learn More" buttons use `data-doc` attribute to reference internal guides:
- `ACCESSIBILITY_GUIDE` → `/docs/guides/ACCESSIBILITY_GUIDE.md`
- `KEYGUARD_WORKFLOW_GUIDE` → `/docs/guides/KEYGUARD_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`

Currently, these links open the Features Guide modal. Future enhancement: display doc content in a modal or navigate to a docs page.
