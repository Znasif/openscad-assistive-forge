# Changelog - v2.3.0

## v2.3.0 (2026-01-15) — Audit & Polish Release

### Overview

Version 2.3.0 is a quality-focused release that performs a comprehensive audit of the codebase, removes debug code, and aligns version strings across all files. This release contains no new features but ensures production readiness and codebase hygiene.

### Fixed

#### Debug Code Removal
- **Removed debug fetch call** from `src/js/auto-preview-controller.js`
  - Eliminated fetch to `http://127.0.0.1:7245/ingest/...` in production code
  - Removed `#region agent log` block entirely
  - Prevents console errors and improves security in production

#### Version String Alignment
- **Updated `src/main.js`**: Version banner now shows `v2.3.0 (Audit & Polish)`
- **Updated `public/sw.js`**: `CACHE_VERSION` updated to `v2.3.0`
- **Updated `package.json`**: Version bumped from `2.2.0` to `2.3.0`

### Audited

The following core runtime modules were reviewed for correctness:

| Module | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `src/js/auto-preview-controller.js` | ✅ Clean | Debug code removed, debouncing logic correct |
| `src/js/parser.js` | ✅ Verified | Parameter extraction working correctly |
| `src/js/preview.js` | ✅ Verified | Three.js integration clean, proper disposal |
| `src/js/library-manager.js` | ✅ Verified | localStorage handling with environment checks |
| `src/js/render-queue.js` | ✅ Verified | Job state management correct |
| `src/worker/openscad-worker.js` | ✅ Verified | Timeout handling and library mounting correct |
| `src/main.js` | ✅ Verified | App initialization and event handling correct |

### Technical Details

- **Bundle Impact**: No size change (code removal offsets version string changes)
- **Cache Invalidation**: Service Worker cache will auto-refresh due to version bump
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% - no breaking changes
