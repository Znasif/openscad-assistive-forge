## 🎬 How to Test Now

### Quick Start

1. **Open the App**:
   ```
   Navigate to: http://localhost:5173
   ```

2. **Load Test Example**:
   - Look for example buttons on welcome screen
   - Or manually upload: `public/examples/library-test/library_test.scad`

3. **Verify Library Detection**:
   - Check browser console for: "Detected libraries: ['MCAD']"
   - See library panel with MCAD marked "required"
   - Badge should show "1"

4. **Test Rendering**:
   - Ensure MCAD is enabled (should be auto-enabled)
   - Set style to "Rounded"
   - Click "Generate STL" or wait for auto-preview
   - Verify no errors about missing MCAD

5. **Check Console**:
   ```javascript
   // Expected messages:
   [Worker FS] Mounting library: MCAD from /libraries/MCAD
   [Worker FS] Successfully mounted library: MCAD (36 files)
   ```

### Full Testing

Follow the comprehensive guide:
```

## 🔍 Manual Testing Checklist

Before declaring feature complete, verify:

### UI Tests
- [ ] Library panel renders correctly
- [ ] Checkboxes work
- [ ] Icons display (⚙️, 🔷)
- [ ] Badge counter accurate
- [ ] Help button works
- [ ] Collapsible details work
- [ ] Responsive on mobile

### Functional Tests
- [ ] MCAD auto-detected in library_test.scad
- [ ] MCAD auto-enabled on load
- [ ] Manual enable/disable works
- [ ] State persists after refresh
- [ ] Render succeeds with MCAD
- [ ] boxes.scad functions work
- [ ] No console errors

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Worker mounts MCAD correctly
- [ ] Manifest fetched successfully
- [ ] Files written to virtual FS
- [ ] OpenSCAD can find MCAD files
- [ ] Include paths resolve correctly
- [ ] Multi-file projects work

### Edge Cases
- [ ] No errors with missing libraries
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Error messages clear
- [ ] Network failures handled
- [ ] Large files (BOSL2) work

---

## 🐛 Known Issues to Watch For

### Potential Issues
1. **CORS errors** - Libraries must be same-origin
2. **Manifest format** - Worker expects specific JSON structure
3. **Path resolution** - Include paths must match library structure
4. **Memory usage** - Large libraries may impact performance
5. **Cache issues** - May need hard refresh after library changes

### Mitigation
- Libraries in `public/` folder (same origin ✅)
- Manifest format validated ✅
- Paths use standard structure ✅
- Monitor console for warnings
- Document refresh procedure

---

## 🚀 Next Actions

### Immediate (Manual Testing)
1. **Test library_test.scad** - Verify MCAD detection and rendering
2. **Check worker console** - Confirm library mounting works
3. **Test enable/disable** - Verify UI toggles function
4. **Test persistence** - Refresh and check state

### Follow-up
1. **Create BOSL2 example** - Test another library
2. **Test multi-file** - ZIP with library usage
3. **Performance benchmark** - Measure render times
4. **Cross-browser test** - Firefox, Safari, Edge
5. **Mobile test** - iOS and Android

### Documentation
1. **Update test results** - Record findings in testing guide
2. **Document issues** - Add to known issues if needed
3. **Update status** - Mark v1.10 as tested
4. **Write deployment guide** - Production considerations
