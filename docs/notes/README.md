# Notes (dev log / scratchpad)

This folder is where I put the “paper trail” stuff that’s useful while building:

- one-off implementation summaries
- test runs and checklists
- migration notes (WASM, libraries, etc.)
- assorted “what I changed and why” writeups

It’s not polished documentation — think of it as my working notebook.
