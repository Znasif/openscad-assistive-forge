# 2026-01-25 (notes)

This folder used to be a pile of “end of sprint” checklists and status docs. I’ve collapsed it down to one file to keep the repo from feeling like a program tracker.

What changed around this date:

- Performance work (binary STL, capability detection, basic benchmarks/metrics).
- Some WASM experimentation around Manifold builds.
- Test/cleanup passes.

If you need the old blow-by-blow, it’s in git history.
