# Mobile Browser Limitations

This document describes known limitations when using the OpenSCAD Assistive Forge on mobile devices.

## Overview

The OpenSCAD Assistive Forge works on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome) but with some limitations due to mobile hardware constraints and browser capabilities. This document helps users understand what to expect and how to work around common issues.

## Memory Constraints

**Issue**: Mobile browsers have stricter memory limits than desktop browsers.

**Impact**:
- Complex models may fail with "out of memory" errors
- Memory limit is typically 256-512MB on mobile vs 1-2GB on desktop
- Rendering large or complex models may crash the browser tab

**Workarounds**:
1. **Reduce `$fn` value**: Use lower circle resolution (e.g., `$fn=32` instead of `$fn=100`)
2. **Simplify geometry**: Reduce the number of operations and mesh complexity
3. **Use preview quality**: Iterate with adaptive preview tiers (lower $fn caps on mobile), only generate full quality for final export
4. **Clear browser cache**: If memory errors persist, clear cache and close other tabs
5. **Restart browser**: Close and reopen the browser to free up memory

**Status**: Known limitation of mobile browsers. Cannot be fully resolved client-side.

## Viewport Resizing

**Issue**: Virtual keyboard and browser chrome (address bar, toolbar) change the viewport height dynamically.

**Status**: ✅ **SOLVED** in v1.4

**Implementation**:
- Uses CSS `dvh` (dynamic viewport height) units for modern browsers
- Fallback for older browsers via Visual Viewport API polyfill
- Sticky action bar remains accessible when keyboard is open
- Layout adjusts smoothly when keyboard appears/disappears

**What Works**:
- Parameter inputs remain accessible when keyboard is open
- Action buttons (Generate STL, Download) stay visible
- No content gets clipped or hidden behind keyboard

## Slower Rendering Performance

**Issue**: Mobile CPUs are less powerful than desktop CPUs.

**Impact**:
- STL generation takes 2-3x longer on mobile devices
- **Preview quality renders**: 5-15 seconds (vs 2-8s on desktop)
- **Full quality renders**: 30-120 seconds (vs 10-60s on desktop)
- Very complex models may timeout (30s preview, 60s full quality)

**Mitigations**:
- Auto-preview uses aggressive tiered $fn capping on mobile (lower caps than desktop)
- Render time estimates account for mobile performance
- Progress indicators keep user informed during long renders
- Timeout warnings appear with options to simplify or retry

**Recommendations**:
- Test complex models on desktop first
- Use simpler models for mobile demonstrations
- Be patient with render times
- Consider reducing model complexity for mobile users

## Touch Target Sizes

**Requirement**: WCAG 2.1 Level AAA requires minimum 44×44px touch targets.

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Details**:
- All buttons, sliders, and interactive elements meet 44×44px minimum
- Increased padding on mobile breakpoint (< 768px width)
- Larger slider thumbs (32px vs 20px on desktop)
- Adequate spacing between controls to prevent mis-taps
- File upload drop zone has large hit area

## File Upload on iOS

**Issue**: iOS Safari has quirks with file input behavior.

**Status**: ✅ **WORKS** with caveats

**What Works**:
- Single .scad file upload via file picker
- ZIP file upload and extraction
- Multiple file selection (for ZIP contents)

**Caveats**:
- File picker shows "Choose File" instead of "Upload" (iOS system dialog)
- Drag-and-drop **not supported** on iOS (automatically falls back to file picker)
- ZIP files work but may show warning dialog on older iOS versions (< 15)
- File names with non-ASCII characters may display incorrectly

**Workarounds**:
- Use file picker button instead of drag-and-drop on iOS
- Use ASCII-friendly file names when possible
- Update to latest iOS for best compatibility

## SharedArrayBuffer Support

**Issue**: Some older mobile browsers don't support SharedArrayBuffer, which is required for multithreaded WASM.

**Status**: ✅ **HANDLED** with fallback

**Details**:
- App detects SharedArrayBuffer availability
- Falls back to single-threaded WASM if unavailable
- Single-threaded mode is slower but functional
- Warning message informs user about degraded performance

**Affected Browsers**:
- iOS Safari < 15.2
- Android Chrome < 92 (depending on site isolation)
- Firefox Android < 79

**Recommendations**:
- Update to latest browser version
- Consider using desktop for complex models
- Simple models work fine in single-threaded mode

## 3D Preview Performance

**Issue**: Mobile GPUs have less memory and processing power than desktop GPUs.

**Impact**:
- Large STL files (>100K triangles) may cause stuttering or lag
- Orbit controls may feel less responsive
- Preview may not render at 60 FPS
- Very large models (>500K triangles) may not render at all

**Mitigations**:
- Preview quality automatically reduces mesh complexity
- LOD (Level of Detail) system reduces vertices for preview
- Vertex count warning appears for large models (>50K vertices)
- Option to simplify preview mesh for better performance

**Recommendations**:
- Download STL and view in dedicated 3D app for large models
- Use preview for basic verification only
- Reduce preview quality if lag occurs

## Landscape vs Portrait Orientation

**Status**: ✅ **SUPPORTED**

**Details**:
- Layout adapts to orientation changes
- Parameters panel stacks in portrait mode
- Preview resizes to fit available space
- No loss of functionality in either orientation

**Recommendations**:
- Landscape orientation recommended for better workflow
- Portrait mode works for quick parameter adjustments
- Preview quality better in landscape (larger viewport)

## Battery and Data Usage

**Issue**: WASM execution and 3D rendering are power-intensive.

**Impact**:
- Extended use will drain battery faster
- Initial WASM download is ~20-30MB (one-time)
- Subsequent visits use cached WASM

**Recommendations**:
- Use WiFi for initial load to avoid mobile data charges
- Keep device plugged in for extended editing sessions
- WASM caches automatically for offline use after first load

## PWA (Progressive Web App) Support

**Status**: ✅ **SUPPORTED**

**What Works**:
- Install as standalone app on home screen
- Offline support after initial load
- App-like experience without browser chrome
- Service worker caches static assets

**Installation**:
- **iOS**: Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen
- **Android**: Chrome → Menu → Add to Home Screen

**Benefits**:
- Faster loading (cached assets)
- Full-screen experience
- Offline parameter editing (rendering requires WASM which caches on first use)

## Audio Feedback

**Status**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Note**: No audio feedback or haptic feedback is provided. Visual feedback only (progress bars, status messages, animations).

## Clipboard Support

**Status**: ✅ **PARTIAL SUPPORT**

**What Works**:
- Copy parameter values as text
- Copy generated code snippets
- Export parameters as JSON

**Limitations**:
- iOS requires user interaction for clipboard access
- "Copy to clipboard" buttons work but may show permission prompt
- Automatic clipboard operations blocked by iOS

## Known Issues

### iOS-Specific

1. **Memory warnings**: iOS aggressively terminates tabs using too much memory
   - **Workaround**: Close other tabs, simplify model

2. **Scroll momentum**: Parameters panel may have fast scroll momentum
   - **Workaround**: Use careful swipes or drag scrollbar directly

3. **Input zoom**: Inputs may zoom page when focused (iOS < 16)
   - **Workaround**: Pinch to zoom out, or use external keyboard

### Android-Specific

1. **Back button**: Android back button may exit app unexpectedly
   - **Workaround**: Use in-app navigation, or install as PWA

2. **Text selection**: Text selection may be difficult in dense parameter UI
   - **Workaround**: Long-press carefully or use landscape mode
