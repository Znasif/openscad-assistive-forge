## Detailed Findings

### 1. OpenSCAD Playground (Official)

**Repository**: https://github.com/openscad/openscad-playground  
**Organization**: Official OpenSCAD project  
**Demo**: Deployed on Vercel (exact URL not publicly listed in repo)  
**Technology Stack**: React, Monaco Editor, OpenSCAD WASM, PrimeReact UI  

**Hosting Provider**: Vercel

**COOP/COEP Headers Present**: ✅ **YES**

**Evidence**:
- **Config file**: `vercel.json` (referenced but not directly viewable in public repo)
- **Purpose**: Enables cross-origin isolation for `SharedArrayBuffer` support
- **Documentation**: DeepWiki analysis confirms the presence of header configuration

**Configuration Details** (from documentation):

According to build system documentation, the `vercel.json` includes:

1. **MIME type headers** for WASM files:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "/(.*\\.wasm)$",
     "headers": [
       { "key": "Content-Type", "value": "application/wasm" }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Cross-origin isolation headers**:
   ```json
   {
     "source": "/(.*)",
     "headers": [
       { "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy", "value": "same-origin" },
       { "key": "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy", "value": "require-corp" }
     ]
   }
   ```

**Why these headers are used**:
> "Ensures correct MIME types for WASM files and enables cross-origin isolation required for SharedArrayBuffer support in the OpenSCAD worker."
> — *Source: DeepWiki analysis of openscad-playground build system*

**Key Observations**:
- This is the **official OpenSCAD web implementation**
- Uses the **same header strategy** we're implementing (COOP/COEP)
- Deployed on **Vercel**, but header approach is **platform-agnostic**
- Explicitly requires `SharedArrayBuffer` for worker-based rendering

**Features**:
- Live code editing with syntax highlighting
- Automatic preview updates (F5) and full render (Ctrl+Enter/F6)
- Customizer support
- Ships with standard SCAD libraries
- Autocomplete for imports and symbols

**Relevance to Our Project**: ✅ **HIGH**
- Most comparable project (both are OpenSCAD-based)
- Uses identical header strategy
- Official implementation validates our approach

**Author**: seasick (community developer)  
**Demo**: https://seasick.github.io/openscad-web-gui/  
**License**: GPL-3.0

**Hosting Provider**: **GitHub Pages**

**COOP/COEP Headers Present**: ❌ **NO** (no configuration found)

**Evidence**:
- Searched repository for: `vercel.json`, `netlify.toml`, `_headers`
- **Result**: None of these files exist in the repository
- GitHub Pages deployment with no explicit header configuration

**Configuration Analysis**:

GitHub Pages does not support:
- Custom `_headers` files (Cloudflare/Netlify feature)
- `vercel.json` (Vercel-specific)
- Response header customization (without service worker workarounds)

**Possible Explanations**:
1. Project uses **non-threaded WASM build** (like our current setup)
2. Relies on localhost `SharedArrayBuffer` availability during development
3. May not require threading features for its use case

**Project Features**:
- Web-based GUI for OpenSCAD using WASM
- Import `.scad` files via URL
- Adapters for Printables and Thingiverse
- Add/import libraries and fonts

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Common Hosting Patterns

**Hosting Platforms Used**:
- **Vercel**: OpenSCAD Playground (official) ✅ Best practice
- **GitHub Pages**: openscad-web-gui, CascadeStudio (community projects)
- **Custom/Unknown**: JSCAD, Replicad

**Observation**: The **official OpenSCAD implementation** chose Vercel with explicit COOP/COEP headers, validating our approach.

### 2. COOP/COEP Header Usage

**Projects with COOP/COEP**:
- ✅ **OpenSCAD Playground** (official): Explicitly configured via `vercel.json`

**Projects without COOP/COEP**:
- ❌ openscad-web-gui: GitHub Pages (no config)
- ❌ JSCAD: No configuration found
- ❓ CascadeStudio: Unknown
- ❓ Replicad: Unknown

**Analysis**:
- **Threading vs Non-Threading**: Projects without headers likely use non-threaded WASM builds
- **Platform Limitations**: GitHub Pages doesn't support custom headers
- **Official vs Community**: Official implementation prioritizes performance (threading)

### 3. Threading Patterns

**Threaded (Requires COOP/COEP)**:
- OpenSCAD Playground (official): Uses `SharedArrayBuffer` for worker-based rendering

**Non-Threaded (Works Without COOP/COEP)**:
- openscad-web-gui: Works on GitHub Pages
- JSCAD: No threading configuration
- Our current setup: `openscad-wasm-prebuilt@1.2.0` (non-threaded)

**Trade-off**:
- **With headers**: Better performance (parallel processing), requires proper hosting
- **Without headers**: Broader compatibility, simpler deployment, slower rendering

### 4. Validation for Our Approach

✅ **Our Cloudflare Pages + COOP/COEP approach is validated**:

1. **Matches official implementation**: OpenSCAD Playground uses the same strategy
2. **Best practices**: COOP/COEP headers are correct for WASM applications
3. **Future-proof**: Ready for threaded WASM builds
4. **Platform choice**: Cloudflare Pages is comparable to Vercel

**Why Cloudflare Pages is good**:
- Native `_headers` file support (like our implementation)
- Free tier with generous limits
- Global CDN
- Simple deployment from Git
- No serverless function limits (fully static)

**Why Cloudflare Pages is better than alternatives**:
- vs **GitHub Pages**: Supports custom headers (GitHub Pages doesn't)
- vs **Vercel**: Free tier more generous, no function limitations
- vs **Netlify**: Similar capabilities, Cloudflare has better CDN

## Appendix: Search Methodology

### Research Process

1. **Identified comparable projects** via web search and GitHub
2. **Searched for configuration files** (`vercel.json`, `netlify.toml`, `_headers`)
3. **Analyzed hosting platforms** (domain inspection, documentation review)
4. **Examined technology stacks** (WASM usage, threading patterns)
5. **Compared approaches** (headers, deployment, performance)

### Search Queries Used

```
- "OpenSCAD Playground official demo github repository"
- "seasick openscad-web-gui github demo site"
- "JSCAD OpenJSCAD web demo github repository"
- "github openscad/openscad-playground vercel.json COOP COEP"
- "CascadeStudio CAD browser WASM demo github"
- "replicad CAD web demo github typescript"
```

### Limitations

- Could not directly inspect live site headers (would require browser testing)
- Some configuration files may be in private branches or not committed
- GitHub Pages limitations prevent header configuration (not a project choice)
- Some projects may use service workers for header workarounds (not investigated)

### Recommendations for Extended Research

If more validation is needed:

1. **Browser testing**: Use DevTools to inspect actual response headers from demo sites
2. **Code analysis**: Clone repos and examine build configurations
3. **Community outreach**: Contact project maintainers about hosting decisions
4. **Historical analysis**: Check commit history for configuration changes
