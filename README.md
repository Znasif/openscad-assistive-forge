# OpenSCAD Assistive Forge

A browser-based OpenSCAD “Customizer” that tries really hard to be usable with keyboards, screen readers, high contrast, and small screens.

- **Live demo**: `https://openscad-assistive-forge.pages.dev/`
- **Docs index**: `docs/README.md`
- **Project status**: `PROJECT_STATUS.md`

## Why this exists

I like parametric OpenSCAD models, but the usual workflow (install app, write code, understand the UI) is a wall for a lot of people — especially folks who rely on assistive tech, and clinicians/caregivers who just need “a few dimensions changed”.

So this is my attempt at: “upload a Customizer-enabled `.scad`, tweak the knobs, preview it, download it” — entirely in the browser.

## What it does

- **Runs OpenSCAD in your browser** (WebAssembly in a Web Worker)
- **Builds a parameter UI** from OpenSCAD Customizer annotations
- **Previews the model** (Three.js) and lets you orbit/pan/zoom
- **Exports** STL/OBJ/OFF/AMF/3MF
- **Supports multi-file projects** via `.zip` (for `include` / `use`)
- **Keeps everything local** (no accounts, no uploads, no backend)

## Accessibility notes (the short version)

I treat accessibility bugs as “real bugs”. A few highlights:

- Keyboard-first interaction, visible focus, skip-link-ish navigation
- Screen reader friendly form markup + status announcements
- Light / dark / high-contrast modes (and Windows forced-colors support)
- Respects reduced motion

More detail lives in `docs/guides/ACCESSIBILITY_GUIDE.md`.

## Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrennenJohnston/openscad-assistive-forge.git
cd openscad-assistive-forge
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173`.

## CLI (developer toolchain)

This repo also has a CLI (`openscad-forge`) for extracting parameters and scaffolding standalone customizers.

```bash
npm install -g .
openscad-forge --help
```
